Art museums and other art places are increasingly exploring the use of interactive guides to make their collections more accessible. In this work, we describe our approach to an interactive multimodal guide prototype that uses audio and tactile modalities to improve the autonomous access to information and experience of visual artworks. The prototype is composed of a touch-sensitive 2.5D artwork relief model that can be freely explored by touch. Users can access localized verbal descriptions and audio by performing touch gestures on the surface while listening to themed background music along. We present the design requirements derived from a formative study realized with the help of eight blind and visually impaired participants, art museum and gallery staff, and artists. We extended the formative study by organizing two accessible art exhibitions. There, eighteen participants evaluated and compared multimodal and tactile graphic accessible exhibits. Results from a usability survey indicate that our multimodal approach is simple, easy to use, and improves confidence and independence when exploring visual artworks.\\nKeywords: accessibility technology; multimodal interaction; auditory interface; touch interface; vision impairment\\nlabel: 0' metadata={'source': 'Despite the use of tactile graphics and audio guides, blind and visually impaired people still face challenges to experience and understand visual artworks independently at art exhibitions.

This provides a parallel trajectory for the nature, realisation and purpose of the art. We then consider the interaction between art and science and the nature of interdisciplinary work by looking at work produced in a sea ice-based science field camp by an artist collecting data - both scientific and art focused. The artist participated in two field campaigns a year apart, allowing comparison of the evolution of both the artistic practice and the science data collection.

              "\"Laparoscopic surgery has been traditionally considered the gold standard in the treatment of endometriosis, especially for cases where surgical intervention is necessary. However, there are other treatment options available for managing endometriosis, depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's symptoms. These may include medication therapy, hormone therapy, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility related to endometriosis. It is important for patients to discuss with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for their individual situation. Additionally, robotic assistance in gynecological surgeries, including those for endometriosis, has shown benefits in more complicated operations, with lower conversion rates to open procedures and improved suturing capabilities compared to traditional laparoscopy. As technology advances and cost considerations are addressed, robotic surgery may become more widely adopted by gynecological surgeons worldwide. Specialized techniques in laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery have shown significant improvements in accuracy, especially in challenging small-size datasets, indicating promising advancements in the field. Management of endometriosis should also consider the chronic nature of the disease and its impact on the reproductive system, with a focus on preserving the patient's chances of pregnancy, even if infertility is not a current concern. ART can play a relevant role in addressing infertility associated with endometriosis, and treatment decisions should be made based on the most recent research and guidelines.\""
